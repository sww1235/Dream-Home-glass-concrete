# Ideas

## location

somewhere in United States that has reasonable weather throughout year, near
water and has active boating community, meaning boats are used either as primary
mode of transportation or as secondary mode. Ideally a somewhat smaller and
somewhat sheltered location that children can be independent in using watercraft
to visit friends and have adventures, potentially even going to school. System
of canals or interconnected lakes

May be modified to have a summer/winter split, I.E, Maine/Seattle and florida.

House would be typical idea for a house, see industrial bachelor pad for ideas,
but would have an attached boathouse/drydock

boat ideas:

Overall, I don't want the boat to be ostentatious and feel like a pleasure boat.
I want something that I could feel comfortable on, potentially with a family.
Also potentially a separate boat for cruising and some light entertaining.
Must not feel posh.

-   20-30ft sailboat with cabin. Would need to learn more about sailing to be
able to use appropriately.

-   similar sized motor yacht with cabin. Would sort of feel like cheating.

-   a boat big enough to cross oceans. Would be nice to be a sail boat, but this
necessitates planning around trade winds.

-   a 12' zodiac for local transport.
