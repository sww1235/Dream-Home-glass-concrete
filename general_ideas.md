general idea dump:


-house has general shape of an inverted 'T' in that the main living area is skinnier
(at least 75' if not skinnier) while the workshop/atrium area is much wider(150') 
-house has living roof with solar panels on top
-theatre set like rooms can be assembled to create smaller spaces for general living
within the larger floors of the house. Openings for doors in these rooms are made
so a door/frame will slot inside a recieving opening on each room. The frame helps
discuise the join so it is half in each room centered on the split.
